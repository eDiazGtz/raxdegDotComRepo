        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Welcome to <a href="#" class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Ghallant</a></h5>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">A World where enemies lurk behind every corner and shadows hold knives around every bend.</p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">There have been rumors of a Cult of Dragons with fanatics that have been robbing towns, assaulting innocents and destroying the lives of the everyday man. The world is in chaos as many are dealt terrible hands by fate as the Cult of the Dragon sweeps their influence throughout. People now cower before the darkness of the Cult. Those few who stand up against it face an onslaught of creatures and plots that threaten to take the power from each and every city.</p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">There are verious factions who work to undermine the Cult of the Dragon. Though usually these factions do not play well with each other, they have opened working together in order to bring this Cult of organized crime down. Without much organization and leadership, the different factions have been working in many different directions and find themselves strained for resources.</p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">It has only been recenly, through a series of events that began in the small town of <a class="text-primary font-weight-bold" href="#">Zidurza</a> that an unlikely group of <a class="text-primary font-weight-bold" href="#">Heroes</a> have risen to meet the cult on various occasions. Now, with justice at their side, they have been chosen by Dragons to help bring about peace and balance to the world. Not many people ride dragons since the days of old. Awestruck, the people of <a class="text-primary font-weight-bold" href="#">Starfall City</a> watch this band of heroes grow in strength and influence as they venture to bringing about peace to the world.</p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">If they cannot bring peace, many fear that, no one could... </p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">What horrible machinations has the Cult of the Dragon for these blasphemers who taint dragons in their eyes?</p>
        <p class="font-weight-bold">What has the Cult in store for... <span class="text-purple">THE DRAGONCHOSEN</span></p>
